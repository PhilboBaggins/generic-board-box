# Generic Board Box

A generic box for holding PCBs with the following characteristics:

* 100 mm x 100 mm size (max size to qualify for JLC PCBs special price)
* 5 mm corner radius
* M3 mounting holes 5 mm from each corner

The screw holes in this box are not threaded but they are slightly smaller than required for a M3 screw and as long as you don't 3D print in a ridiculously tough material, it should be easy to drive a screw into the material (essentially cutting it's own threads). I tested this with JLC's 9000R resin and it worked well. I recommend pushing a screw driver into each mounting hole and twisting it a bit (to create a small dent with rough edges for the screw to get purchase onto) before trying to drive a screw into it.

Note: [PCB.dxf](PCB.dxf) was exported from PCB design software. [PCB.scad](PCB.scad) was used to produce [PCB.stl](PCB.stl), which was then used as a reference in [BoardBox.blend](BoardBox.blend).
